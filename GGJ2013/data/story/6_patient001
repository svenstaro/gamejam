My first attempt at the creation of a Überhuman, is my own younger sister Cloe. Born with a heart defect, she was struggling for life since she was a child. I spent days and nights without sleep to find a solution that would help. In the last month her constitution got worse and worse, day after day, step by step...

Today she died before I was able to help her. Everything I learned was useless, and nothing I tried worked out. But I found a method to help the Heart survive. In the end, Project X did serve a purpose.
